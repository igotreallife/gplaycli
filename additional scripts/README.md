Basic Informations
==================

Run those scripts in the following Order:

 - csv_decoder
 - counter
 - change

The only file really required is the csv file with data, the others however
should be generated automatically.

Note that the scripts only look in their directory for specifically named files.
For that reason the csv HAS to be named "clps.csv" if you don't change the name
in the script.

Also consult the comments in the scripts for more information.
